# python-spotify-wrapper
Hacked together wrapper for Spotify API using OAuth 2.0

Had to make a quick wrapper for the Spotify API for [another project](https://github.com/platelminto/spotify-easy-save-song), decided to share because alternative that I was initially using is buggy at best. Definitely not a full wrapper, doesn't really handle error codes (at least not right now), but after initial authentication manages to be painless for end-user.
